# rewrite-java-ee-7-primefaces-5

This repository shows a minimal setup code needed to run powerful url routing and rewriting tool [ocpsoft rewrite](http://ocpsoft.org/rewrite/).

The work is based on [java-ee-7-primefaces-5](https://github.com/cilf/java-ee-7-primefaces-5) example.

I'm deploying it locally to Wildfly 8.1.0.Final using IntelliJ IDEA 13.1.5.
